# HungryHub
## Purpose
A delivery prototype app that allows users to order food and get it delivered to their door. It's a test app, there isn't any transaction being facilitated or any food delivered.

## Built With
- React - Front-end
- Bootstrap - Styling
- DynamoDB - Database
- AWS Cognito - Authentication

## Authors
Jasmina Topalovic, Syrinthia Swift, Jeremy Lehmann, Aphra Hiat, Jeffrey Smith

## Areas of improvement
- Having a page with previous orders and a quick way to re-order them.
- Search feature which allows to look for a restaurant based on food type (Italian, asian etc.).
- Notification when the food is delivered.

## Acknowledgments
This app was inspired by real delivery applications like UberEats, Grubhub and Doordash.
